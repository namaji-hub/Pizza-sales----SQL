Pizza Sales Analysis Project

Insights and Strategies Through Oracle SQL Developer

Introduction to Pizza Sales Analysis

The Pizza Sales Analysis project focuses on analyzing pizza order data to derive insights on sales patterns, popular pizza types, and revenue trends. It uses SQL queries to explore various business metrics such as total orders, revenue, and pizza preferences.

I developed a sales data analysis project using Oracle SQL Developer to derive actionable insights. The database consisted of four relational tables: Pizzas, Pizza Types, Orders, and Order Details. This project focused on optimizing queries and analyzing trends for improved decision-making.

Project Overview

This project collects and analyzes data related to pizza sales using four tables: Pizzas, Pizza Types, Orders, and Order Details. It computes various metrics like total orders, revenue, pizza sizes, categories, and distribution. The analysis helps identify trends, popular pizza types, and customer preferences.

Database Schema

Pizzas Table: Pizza ID, Pizza Type ID, Pizza Size, Price.

Pizza Types Table: Pizza Type ID, Name, Category, Ingredients.

Orders Table: Order ID, Order Date, Order Time.

Order Details Table: Order Detail ID, Order ID, Pizza ID, Quantity.

Data Cleaning and Preparation

Before analysis, data must be cleaned and prepared. This involves:

Removing duplicates

Correcting errors

Formatting data consistently

Proper preparation enhances the reliability of SQL queries and the insights derived from them.

Advanced SQL Techniques

Use of aggregation functions: COUNT, SUM, AVG, and ROUND.

Filtering data with WHERE clauses.

Combining tables using JOIN operations.

Grouping data with GROUP BY.

Advanced techniques: RANK, PARTITION, and window functions (OVER).

Strategic Recommendations

Based on our analysis, strategic recommendations include:

Adjusting menu offerings to highlight popular pizza types.

Designing targeted marketing campaigns.

Optimizing pricing strategies based on revenue trends.

Data-driven decisions enhance customer satisfaction and increase sales.

Challenges in Data Analysis

Challenges encountered:

Data quality issues

Integration of disparate data sources

Advanced analytical skill requirements

Addressing these challenges ensures successful data-driven decision-making.

Conclusion and Future Directions

This project utilized Oracle SQL Developer to analyze pizza sales trends effectively. Advanced SQL queries provided actionable insights, demonstrating the power of data-driven strategies to support informed decision-making and future growth.
